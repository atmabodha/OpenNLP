# RAG Chatbot

# NYD Hackathon 2025

Hackathon held around **National Youth Day (January 12, 2025)**

### 🚀 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot

This project was jointly implemented by the members of the top 5 teams who participated in the NYD Hackathon 2025. It implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** that provides insightful responses using verses from the **Bhagavad Gita** and **Patanjali Yoga Sutras**. The chatbot supports **query auto-completion, query prediction, document retrieval, reranking, dynamic response generation, and response validation**.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Query Auto-Completion:** Predicts and suggests possible queries.
- **🧠 Intelligent Query Prediction:** Refines user queries for better results.
- **📄 Contextual Document Retrieval:** Uses **FAISS/Qdrant** to fetch relevant verses.
- **📊 Reranking & Filtering:** Ensures the best-matching results are prioritized.
- **🤖 Dynamic Prompt Templates:** Generates structured and contextually rich responses.
- **✅ Response Review & Validation:** Ensures quality by re-generating responses if validation fails.
- **📡 API-Driven Architecture:** Backend built with **FastAPI** and frontend with **React + Next.js**.
- **🐳 Docker-Ready:** Easily deployable as separate **frontend** and **backend** services.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### **1️⃣ Backend Setup (FastAPI)**

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

### **2️⃣ Frontend Setup (React + Next.js)**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **3️⃣ Run with Docker (Recommended)**

```bash
# Backend
cd iks-rag-pipelines
docker build -t iks-rag-pipelines .
docker run -p 8000:8000 iks-rag-pipelines

# Frontend
cd iks-rag-ui
docker build -t iks-rag-ui .
docker run -p 3000:3000 iks-rag-ui
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### **With Docker Compose**

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  backend:
    build: ./iks-rag-pipelines
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - ENV=production

  frontend:
    build: ./iks-rag-ui
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - iks-rag-pipelines
```

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## ✅ Best Practices Followed

✔️ **Modular architecture** (Separate concerns for retrieval, ranking, generation).  
✔️ **Scalable API** (Using **FastAPI** for async support).  
✔️ **Efficient vector search** (Using **FAISS / Qdrant** for document retrieval).  
✔️ **React + Next.js** (Server-side rendering for faster UI loading).  
✔️ **Containerized setup** (Docker for seamless deployment).  
✔️ **Unit & Integration Tests** (Ensuring API reliability).  
✔️ **OpenAPI Documentation** (Auto-generating Swagger docs).

## Hackathon Task & Guidelines

1. Find a few relevant shlokas (verses) from the Bhagavad Gita and Patanjali Yoga Sutras (PYS) for a user query using LLMs and other information retrieval techniques. You can use this [dataset](https://www.github.com/atmabodha/Vedanta_Datasets) as a starting point to build upon. Feel free to explore various strategies for chunking, reranking, fine-tuning, etc.

2. Feed the retrieved shlokas along with the user query to an open source LLM like LLaMA to generate a summary of the answer. You are expected to work on creating a suitable prompt for this purpose that minimizes hallucinations.

3. Generate the output in a suitable JSON format.

4. Need to identify irrelevant or inappropriate user queries.

5. Do a thorough analysis of the generated answers for a wide variety of user queries.

6. Evaluation Criteria:

- Accuracy of the top verse retrieved for these curated questions from Gita and PYS.

- Quality of the prompt written and summarised answers generated using an open source LLM.

- Depth and quality of the analysis of the results.

- Cost of generating answer per query and lean architecture of the pipeline.

---

## Hackathon Rules

- Each team should have 1-3 members.

- Team members can be students or working professionals.

- All the code or ideas used from elsewhere must be properly cited in the submission report.

- Use only Open Source LLMs like SBERT, LLaMA, etc for all tasks like embeddings, text generation, etc.

- The code submitted for final evaluation must be made openly available for anyone to use.

- Incomplete or inappropriate submissions will be rejected.

- Prize money will be distributed through UPI or as Amazon Gift Vouchers to the team lead.

- Decision of the judges will be final.
