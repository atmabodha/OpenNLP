## üéØ Objective

The [NYD Hackathon 2025](https://github.com/atmabodha/OpenNLP/tree/main/NYD_Hackathon_2025) focused on building a Gita chatbot, while the [IYD Hackathon 2025](https://github.com/atmabodha/OpenNLP/tree/main/IYD_Hackathon_2025) centered on creating a Ramayana fact-checker. Now, the NYD 2026 Hackathon will bring these two ideas together ‚Äî developing an open source chatbot that also serves as a fact-checker.

Unlike traditional hackathons, this one will run for 4 months with staged submissions. Each stage has clear deliverables, and winners will be chosen based on performance at each stage. The final winner will be the team/individual with the best cumulative performance across all four stages.
